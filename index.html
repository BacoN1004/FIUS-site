        <h3 id="Text1">Hi there,
            We are a community that is working hard to grow and that, in the not too distant future, would like to become a company. 
            <br>
            <br>
            We are here to give the world a unique, connected and better organized place, trying to do everything connected to the others, a bit like the idea from which the internet was born, but, with our project, better.
            <br>
            <br>
            We are divided into large groups, among which are distinguished: the main one (i.e. where everything that is not in the other groups is done, for example: community, minecraft server support, support requests for moderation and payment ...)
            the development branch (which created this site). This deals with programming of any type and with any language (of which the need arises). When a new language comes to us, perhaps as impressive as Java, or with many modules like NodeJS, we don't all get together to study it, or rather, not initially. Let's give someone who might have created the idea to do with that language to study it. 
            <br>
            <br>
            When he has at least the basics he starts giving lessons to others, or rather, short events (registered if possible) where everyone, developers of this group and not, can learn. We call this idea online code school.
            <br>
            <br>
            A last branch that stands out is the branch of entertainment, which deals with creating videos, editing them (including online code school recordings), creating music and animations or real series to be published on official social networks or on the social networks of our partners.</h3>
